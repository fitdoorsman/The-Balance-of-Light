# ✨ The Balance of Light

A retro-pixel 2D platformer built in Godot 4.5.

Collect Light Orbs, push back the darkness, avoid demons, and activate the Exit Portal to win.

---

## 🎮 Overview

Darkness is spreading across the realm, and the world is losing its light.

Angels send Light Orbs to help you restore balance, but demons patrol the land and will strike if you touch them.

Explore two playable levels, collect enough Light Orbs to brighten the world, and reach the Exit Portal to escape.
