✨ The Balance of Light

A retro-pixel 2D platformer built in Godot 4.5.

Collect Light Orbs to push back darkness, avoid demons, and activate the Exit Portal to advance through levels.

🎮 Overview

Darkness is spreading across the realm, and only scattered Light Orbs can restore balance.

Angels send Light Orbs to help you, but demons patrol the world and will strike if you touch them.

Explore two playable levels, collect enough orbs to increase the world’s brightness, and reach the Exit Portal to win.
